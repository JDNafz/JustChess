JC by JD

## Description

It's a chess website, it is deployed at [JCbyJD.com](https://JCbyJD.com) check, it out! 

I had a great time sorting through all the challenges of coding a game of chess from scratch, and still have some goals left to make it seamless.

I can't wait to expand it's functionality more in the coming weeks after I graduate. Thanks for checking it out.

## Demo:

2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly.
