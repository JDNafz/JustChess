        <p className="aboutText">
          JC by JD was created using PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node (the
          PERN stack). Before getting into web development I started my career
          with a certification in Python Algorithms from AlgoExpert, and fell in
          love with solving complex problems using efficient and elegant code.
          This project is definitely super efficient nor elegant, but I'd love
          to take another pass at it after I get everything working ðŸ˜….
        </p>
        <p className="aboutText">
          Besides coding, I have a passion for dance, especially West Coast
          Swing. I dance regularly in the Twin Cities and travel competing at
          national and international events. I also love taking care of my
          bonsai trees, may they remain small forever ðŸ’–
